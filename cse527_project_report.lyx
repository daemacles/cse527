\begin_layout Title
CSE527 Au12 Project Report -- A Genome Wide Motif Search
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
James Youngquist

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This report describes a method for searching an entire genome for motifs.
 While I limited my searches to nucleotide motifs on DNA regions outside
 of genes, there is nothing in principle that prevents this method from
 being used for codon searches within genes.
 However, unless specified otherwise, all references to searching, motifs,
 etc.
 refer to nucleotide motifs on non-gene regions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Motifs are repeating sequences that are found throughout a genome and which
 may have biological significance in their own right.
 For example, the TATA box is a motif found in the promoter regions of some
 genes that acts as a binding site for transcription factors (TF) [* http://www.n
cbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1955227/].
 Because TF binding sites can be bound by both gene promoters and suppressors,
 if one can discover a TF motif, then that gives some information about
 which genes are related.
 That is, two genes which share a TF motif will both be influenced in similar
 ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specifically, I chose to explore the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
as downloaded from http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/sacCer3/bigZips/
\end_layout

\end_inset

 because 1) it is fully sequenced, 2) it is annotated with gene locations,
 and 3) it is small enough for my limited computing resources to analyze.
 S.
 cerevisiae has about 6000 genes across 16 nuclear chromasomes and slightly
 over 12 million basepairs in total.
 Of the 12 million base pairs, roughly 27% are outside known or suspected
 genes, according to the UCSC genome annotations database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three main portions to this report.
 They are, in order, the method I used (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Method"

\end_inset

), results and discussion (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Results"

\end_inset

), and finally the tools and and techniques I developed to support my method
 (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Tools-and-Techniques"

\end_inset

).
 I close with thoughts about future work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Prior Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of computationally searching for motifs is not new.
 One technique is to use expectation maximization (EM) to find sequences
 that are highl y likely to be motifs.
 The EM method is not typically used for searches across an entire genome,
 but for a selected set of sequences.
 There are also databases of known motifs such as TRANSFAC (http://www.gene-
 regulation.com/pub/databases.html, limited free functionality) and JASPAR
 (http://jaspar.genereg.net/).
 The wikipedia page for 'Sequence Motif' has an extensive list of software
 and databases related to motif finding.

Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we want to find which TF motifs are most prevalent on the S.
 cerevisiae genome.
 The naive approach is, for each length of motif desired, to convolve all
 possible combinations of that length along the non gene coding regions
 of some organism's genome.
 A sequence of length N is considered a match at some position along the
 genome if its convolution score there is sufficiently high.
 Then, one simply records which test sequences result in the most 'hits'
 along the genome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Convolution here means the sum of matching nucleotides between some test
 sequence and a position on the genome, where mismatches have a weight of
 -1.
 For example, the convolution of AAAA and AAAG has a score of 
\begin_inset Formula $+3-1=2$
\end_inset

, and AAA convolved along AAGTC results in the sequence of scores 
\begin_inset Formula $<1,-1,-3>$
\end_inset

 (I discard positions without complete overlap).
 Thus, for 10-mers in the case of S.
 cerevisiae, 
\begin_inset Formula $4^{10}\cdot3.3\times10^{6}=$
\end_inset

3.3 trillion comparisons would have to be made.
 This does not account for gaps, additions, elisions or other small variations
 in the test sequences.
 This is a combinatorial problem and so clearly 
\emph on
the naive method is not scalable
\emph default
 above a small number of base pairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key observation is that motifs can be represented by varying base sequences
 that fulfil the same biological function.
 That is, small changes in chemistry (e.g.
 base pair substitution) do not radically effect the purpose of a given
 motif.
 Hence the naive approach also fails in that it would consider 
\noun on
TATATT
\noun default
CAAATG, TATATTGAAATG and TATATTCAAA* to be different motifs even though
 they very likely represent the same one, though the last is in fact shorter
 by one base pair.
 My solution to this dual problem with the naive approach is to use a modified
 Needleman-Wunsch (mNW) algorithm, where no backtracking is done, instead
 of plain convolution.
 Further, I only use a randomly selected subset of all possible N-mers.
 I accept a sequence as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 via simple thresholding on the final score: a score of 9 or 10 was accepted
 for 10-mers under test, which allows for some wiggle-room in terms of closeness
 and nucleotide variance among the same motif.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a probabilistic approximation approach.
 It is (hopefully) biologically sound because a large enough subset of test
 sequences with an appropriate threshold covers a significant portion of
 possible matches.
 Even though the mNW algorithm is quadratic instead of linear in the test
 sequence size, I do not have to test all sequences and also get positive
 results for sequences that match against motifs of length 9 and 11 as well
 as 10.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the main benefits of this approach, unlike the EM algorithm for motif
 finding, is that it is trivially parallelized.
 Testing each random guess is independent of all other guesses.
 Thus, each mNW sweep through the non gene regions can be done separately
 in its own process across networked machines and all results accumulated
 by another process.
 For this project I had access to about 28 logical cores (14 without hyperthread
ing).
 Speed is linear in the number of processing cores available.

Results and Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My results come from 20,000 randomly generated test sequences of length
 10.
 At face value, 20,000 sequences only covers 2% of all length 10 sequences,
 but as mentioned above my algorithm accounts for motifs that vary slightly
 in their composition and so I believe this is sufficient to capture high
 scoring motifs.
 See Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for the top 30 scoring sequences I found.
 The top 10 sequences are visualized in Figure

Most of the top scoring sequences are composed primarily of T and A bases.
 Since in the bond between A and T is weaker than that between G and C,
 this lends evidence for biologically significance.
 A prevalence of AT bonds is common at locations where the DNA strand must
 be unwound and separated, e.g.
 the commonly known TATA box.
 For example, the top scoring sequence,

TACTTTTTTT/AAAAAAAGTA was frequently located very close to an adjacent gene,
 even when there was a large gap between the genes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, I was unable to find these sequences after a search on TRANSFAC
 and JASPER as being known TF motifs for S.
 cerevisiae .
 Unfortunately TRANSFAC's public academic database is 7 years out of date,
 whereas the yeast data I analyzed is from April, 2011.
 However, I did find the TRANSFAC interface to be confusing and it is quite
 possible that, lacking the appropriate biology background, I just searched
 incorrectly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The numerical distribution of results is quite interesting.
 It appears that only a few sequences are highly prevalent, that is the
 distribution of hits has a long tail and narrow peak.
 This would imply that more sequences could be searched because guessing
 the few highest scoring sequences is not likely.
 Likewise, many

\end_inset

 motifs could be lost in the noise of the long tail.
 Thus, this technique is not well suited for directly discovering motifs
 shared by only a few genes.
 However, this method could be useful as a filter, highlighting promising
 sequences for more in depth analysis or further experimentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also of note is that that though the motifs I found do not show any visable
 bias among chromosomes, they do fall non-uniformly on each chromosome.
 There are, for example, both clumps of each sequence and also regions where
 they are sparsely found.

Much thought went into a software design that would scale well and work
 with large datasets.
 Though the S.
 cerevisiae genome is only about 12 million base pairs, I wanted a system
 that could handle human genome size datasets with little or no modification.
 Another design goal was an intuitive API that could be used by others with
 little training.
 Python was chosen as the implementation langauge for its ease of use and
 simultaneous ability for high numeric performance through the NumPy

\end_inset

 extensions.
 In all, about 1000 lines of Python code were written.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the first goal, I make heavy use of memory mapping through NumPy array
 primitives.
 Memory mapping allows one to treat a file on the disk as the backing store
 for virtual memory and NumPy has direct support for keeping an arrays data
 in a memory mapped region.
 Sequence data is represented as a byte array where T=0, C=1, A=2 and G=3.
 Apart from the time required to convert the .2bit format provided by genome.ucsc.e
du, program startup is almost instantaneous and the OS handles swaping genome
 pages in and out of memory as needed.
 In this way even the human genome can be efficiently analyzed as the no
 explicit user memory management is required.
 Further, apart from the randomly generated test sequences, all subsequences
 (represented as NumPy arrays) used in my program are 'views' of the main
 genome array, NumPy parlance for pointers to offsets.
 Therefor memory overhead is minimized and speed is increased by avoiding
 the need for python to allocate and copy memory for millions of temporary
 objects that get used once.
 Finally, a proper OS implementation of shared (memmapped) memory shares
 that memory between separate processes so that multiple processes referencing
 the same memmapped file on disk do not actually use more memory than a
 single process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, even with memory mapping tricks, Python is notoriously slow for
 program flow control.
 For example, the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is quadratic in the size of
 its input -- a double 'for' loop.
 A pure Python implementation is over 100 times slower than the equivalent
 C implementation due to Python's dynamic typing.
 At every iteration of a loop, code must be needlessly run that repeatedly
 checks the types of all variables being referenced.
 Luckily, an extension to Python call Cython has been written.
 Cython allows Python functions to be written that include type information,
 a trivial modification over the original Python code.
 Cython then compiles this modified Python code into optimized C, which
 is then compiled by GCC into a native Python extension.
 In the case of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm I saw a speedup of 100x using
 Cython over pure Python.
 Cython was used here any time I had a tight inner loop or was doing low
 level manipulation of the data arrays.
 It was the main reason that Python was suitable for this project, which
 allowed it to be completed in much less time than had I chosen to use only
 C or C++.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the course of developing the motif searching code, I first needed to
 get the data in a form convenient for use.
 The genome.ucsc.edu provides raw text dumps of their annotations database
 and genome data in the .2bit format.
 The annotations database includes gene locations on a chromosome as well
 as a brief description of that gene.
 The .2bit format is a compressed binary format where each file can contain
 multiple sequences and each sequence has associated metadata.
 The actual genetic code is stored four base pairs to a byte using the same
 code as described above (T=0, ...).
 The metadata includes a sequence name, e.g.
 'chrI' for chromosome I, and any masking regions in the genome, i.e.
 places with incomplete data.
 I created a Python class, Genome, to wrap around both the annotation (importing
 it into a Sqlite3 database) information and to decode and cache the .2bit
 information.
 With an instance of the Genome class, it is easy to do tasks such as iterate
 over all known gene (or non-gene) sequences in the genome or query for
 other such related information.

\begin_layout Standard
The appropriate threshold to use for accepting a match from the mNW algorithm
 is unknown to me.
 Lower values mean less selectivity and potential duplication, but also
 allow one to test fewer sequences and are more general in the motifs that
 are returned.
 Duplication can be accounted for by another round of the NW algorithm among
 the top sequences to merge highly similar results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several correlation analyses which would be interesting to perform.
 For example,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The correlation between motifs and gene sense -- are some motifs most often
 associated with forward or reverse coded genes? Is there no bias?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The correlations between the top scoring motifs -- how similar are the top
 scoring motifs? Could all of, say, the top 5 most frequent sequences really
 be merged into a compound sequence represented by a single position weight
 matrix?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What is the correlation between top scoring motifs and other low scoring
 motifs? Similarly, are many of the low scoring motifs merely facets of
 one larger compound motif?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm also curious about improving the computational side of this method,
 namely, increasing performance and accuracy.
 It would be interesting to see if it could be adapted to a GPU to take
 advantage the high parallelism available there.
 Another promising idea is to adapt this technique to use some sort of multigrid
 method.
 Every motif of length N that is found also contains a motif of length N-1
 that would have been found from a search of lengths N-1.
 Therefor, one could start with shorter search lenghts, e.g.
 6--8, and use the top matches from that length as seed for the next higher
 length.
 This would significantly reduce the search space for longer motifs whose
 permutations grow combinatorially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Convolution with the modified Needleman-Wunsch algorithm generated several
 interesting motifs with strong evidence for biological significance among
 the highest scoring.
 This method of motif discovery is promising, but has much room for improvement
 and optimization as currently implemented.
 It is not suitable for all types of motif discovery or analysis, but could
 be useful for highlighting motifs for further study or to be run on newly
 sequenced genomes as a first line of analysis.
